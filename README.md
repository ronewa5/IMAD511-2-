My App defines a list of famous people and what age they passed away (eg, “Mongezi passed away at the age of 31. The aim is to show the logic to match the age of this famous person history. The purpose of the app is created to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. This app provides human interaction with software and offer decision support a specific task. This app is tool to students, depending on how it is developed and used. This app can help improve access to education healthcare, it will benefit every student who is willing to use the little knowledge the app has.
The stage of this app is understanding Data preparation. A software application that uses my app to perform specific tasks and solve problems. Azure labs services and Android studio are the website that built the app. “Azure Labs Services enables you to create labs with infrastructure managed by azure. The service handles all the infrastructure management, from spinning up virtual machines (VMs) to handling errors and scaling the infrastructure. For 
example, configure labs for specific class types, such as data science or general programming, and quickly assign lab users their dedicated lab virtual machine”. 
Android studio helps you improve the performance of your code. It offers developers more room for it, its advanced development tools like a highly flexible Gradle system.
The app is very easy to use and fun at the sometime. To make the interface I used Android studio to structure the app, components in the app I used text view and button and different types of fonts to make presentable and professional. I even added an image as a background. Then the instructions on the app I used Azure Labs

The whole entire interface the background is orange.
Tested my Debug on Azure labs Services where I instructed my app to operate and I checked my errors they were okay 0 errors I made sure then my emulator ran successfully 

In the rapidly evolving landscape of mobile technology, Android Studio stands as a beacon for developers seeking to craft innovative and engaging experiences for users worldwide. As the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development, Android Studio has revolutionized the way developers create, debug, and deploy applications for the Android platform.

At its core, Android Studio is a sophisticated software toolkit that streamlines the entire app development process, from inception to distribution. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive feature set, it empowers developers to unleash their creativity and build high-quality apps that resonate with users across diverse demographics.

One of the key pillars of Android Studio is its robust code editor, which supports multiple programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, and C++. Developers can leverage advanced code completion, syntax highlighting, and refactoring tools to write clean, efficient code with ease. Additionally, the IDE offers seamless integration with version control systems like Git, enabling collaborative development and efficient code management.

Beyond code editing, Android Studio provides a rich set of tools for designing captivating user interfaces. Through its visual layout editor, developers can create pixel-perfect UI designs using drag-and-drop functionality, while simultaneously previewing their layouts across various screen sizes and resolutions. This visual feedback loop accelerates the design iteration process and ensures optimal user experience on a multitude of devices.
